## Getting Started

This is a E-commerce application using the fakestore API more of which can be found here https://fakestoreapi.com/docs.
All the constants can be found on the constraints.dart file. I have used the HTTP package in dart for handling the API 
calls. ALong with which I have used Google Fonts to help with the style and the size of the application. Since, this is only a 2 page application normal routing method like Material Page Route is used. 

The user could find a drawer on the home screen where you can find the source code attached which will link to my repository. Users could tap on the cart item and the product will be added to the cart. The number of products will also depend on how many times user clicks on the cart icon.
